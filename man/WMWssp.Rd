\title{Sample size calculation for the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.}
\usage{
WMWssp(x, y, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8, t = 1/2, simulation = FALSE,
  nsim = 10^4)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{prior information for the first group}

\item{y}{prior information for the second group}

\item{alpha}{two sided type I error rate}

\item{power}{power}

\item{t}{proportion of subjects in the first group}

\item{simulation}{TRUE if a power simulation should be carried out}

\item{nsim}{number of simulations for the power simulation}
}
\value{
Returns an object from class WMWssp containing

\item{result}{A dataframe with the results.}

\item{t}{The allocation rate which was used.}

\item{alpha}{The type-I error rate which was used.}

\item{simulation}{The achieved power in a simulation.}

\item{power}{The power which was used.}

\item{N}{The sample size needed.}
}
\description{
This function calculates the sample size for a given power, type-I error rate and allocation rate t = n_1/N. Additionally, the actual achieved power can be simulated.

# generate data for treatment group based on a shift effect

# calculate sample size
